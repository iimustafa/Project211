# Stadium Crowd Behavior Detection System - Requirements Analysis

## Data Analysis

Based on the provided synthetic dataset generation notebook, I've identified the following characteristics:

### Dataset Structure
- **Format**: The dataset follows the COCO annotation format
- **Images**: 500 synthetic images (512x384 pixels) of stadium stands with cartoon-like fans
- **Annotations**: JSON file with bounding boxes and attributes for each fan
- **Fan Properties**:
  - Team affiliation: 'hilal' (blue) or 'ittihad' (gold)
  - Action states: 'sitting', 'cheering', 'fighting', or 'throwing'
- **Image Generation**: Each image contains 3-8 randomly placed fans with random team affiliations and actions

### System Requirements

Based on the dataset and project goals, the system should:

1. **Detect Fans**: Identify and locate fans in drone-view stadium images
2. **Classify Behavior**: Determine if a fan is engaged in problematic behavior (fighting, throwing)
3. **Identify Team Affiliation**: Determine which team a fan supports (hilal/ittihad)
4. **Detect Misplaced Fans**: Identify fans supporting one team sitting in another team's section
5. **Alert System**: Generate alerts with location information and images for security personnel

## Technical Approach

To implement this system, we'll need:

1. **Object Detection Model**: To identify and locate fans in the images
2. **Classification Model**: To classify fan behavior and team affiliation
3. **Alert Generation System**: To create and send alerts to security personnel
4. **Integration Framework**: To combine these components into a cohesive system

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Real-time Processing**: The system should process video feeds in real-time or near real-time
2. **Accuracy**: High accuracy is crucial to avoid false alarms
3. **Scalability**: The system should handle multiple camera feeds and large crowds
4. **Privacy Concerns**: Consider privacy implications of surveillance systems
5. **Transition from Synthetic to Real Data**: The current dataset is synthetic; adaptation to real-world data will be necessary

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environment with required libraries (TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenCV)
2. Develop and train object detection model for fan identification
3. Implement behavior and team affiliation classification
4. Create alert system with visualization capabilities
5. Integrate components into a complete system
6. Test and evaluate system performance
7. Document solution and provide usage instructions
